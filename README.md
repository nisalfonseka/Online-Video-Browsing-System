Payment Function Using Java Servlets
This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). The primary objective of the project is to implement a payment processing function using Java Servlets. It showcases the integration of OOP concepts with web-based applications, focusing on handling user inputs, processing payments, and generating responses dynamically through servlets.

Project Overview
The payment function allows users to input their payment details, processes the data, and confirms the transaction. The project demonstrates the use of Java Servlets to manage web requests and responses, applying OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The main functionality includes:

Validating payment details.
Processing payments.
Returning success or failure messages based on transaction status.
Features
User input validation for payment details.
Dynamic web pages generated using Servlets.
Secure transaction processing.
Error handling for failed transactions.
Response generation based on the transaction outcome.
Technologies Used
Java
Java Servlets
HTML & CSS for the front-end
Apache Tomcat (or any other servlet container)
MySQL (optional, if the payment data is stored in a database)
